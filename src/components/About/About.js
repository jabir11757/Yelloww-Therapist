                    The Yellow Therapist is an integrated platform that aspires to uplift the existing state of mental 
                    health services of Bangladesh. Removing as many obstacles as possible between the one who needs help and the one who can provide- is what we are striving for. In our platform, the therapists and the ones who need the therapy can easily get in touch with each other. At the end of the day, it's the connection that will bring positive outcomes. 
                    We are relentlessly working for a better tomorrow where no soul suffers, where every heart is at peace.
